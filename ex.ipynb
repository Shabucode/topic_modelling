      "She nodded and said, “It's skipping and stopping.”\n",

      "my days measured neatly by the clock on my wall, the ticking of the watch\n",
      "I wore on my wrist, translucent skin-cloaked bone. I kept having to punch\n",

      "or too thin. But I stood in front of the mirror , saying, Maybe. Maybe thin\n",
      "enough .\n",
      "This was a miracle. The absolute truism of eating disorders is that you\n",

      "what's perception? Where is the absolute standard?\n",
      "It didn't matter anyway , because I did not eat.\n",
      "The near -total cessation of food happened very quickly . I had not\n",
      "necessarily intended to cut back on eating; when I left for W ashington, I\n",
      "was already at such a low intake level that it did not occur to me that I\n",
      "could, or should, lower it further still. But I did, eliminating what seemed a\n",
      "few superfluous bits of food. On the surface, I did it as catharsis; food\n",
      "suddenly seemed to be a burden, a strain on my limited time, and I pruned\n",

      "pressing the breath out of you. They tighten further still until you cannot\n",
      "move at all. Even then they do not stop.\n",
      "This is how my system of eating had worked when I was in Minneapolis:\n",
      "Food was divided into units. A unit consisted of eighty calories, the\n",
      "equivalent of your average slice of bread. Of course I made this system up\n",
      "in my head, and do not, to this day , understand why this particular system\n",
      "held such significance for me. This is how we work, we all have our\n",
      "systems. A friend of mine used to divide food arbitrarily into liquids and\n",
      "solids—solids including soup, bread, pasta, rice; liquids including\n",

      "putting into words the passion we have for our systems.\n",
      "They are as near and dear to us as any saving God. W e know them better\n",
      "than we know the alphabet, we know them in the deepest part of the brain,the way the hand knows how to write, even in the dark. They are the only\n",

      "down to four .\n",
      "Four units. Line up four apples and think about how you'd feel after a few\n",
      "days of eating that and nothing else. Or four slices of bread. Or one carton\n",
      "of yogurt and an orange. Or two bagels. Or a pile of carrot sticks and a bowl\n",
      "of cereal. I was eating 320 calories a day .\n",
      "The term “starvation diet” refers to 900 calories a day . I was on one-third of\n",

      "what his deal was. You couldn’t be that smart and that hot and that nice and\n",
      "not secretly be crazy, or a werewolf, or something. I found it deeply\n",

      "would’ve let him put his fingers down my pants, but a strange kind of\n",

      "girl, I wasn’t privy to the mating behaviors of popular alpha males. But I\n",

      "howled in protest.\n",
      "I rose from my perch on the toilet seat, shakily opened the latch, and\n",
      "stepped out into the blazing sunshine. Then the earth tilted in front of me,\n",
      "and I hit the ground.It was probably the most dramatic exit I’ve ever made from a lavatory.\n",
      "The response was appropriate: Mr. Brixton let out a very small, very\n",

      "“Can she hear us?” Mr. Brixton asked.\n",
      "“SARA!” Mr. D’Angelo yelled. “CAN YOU HEAR US?”\n",
      "To my disappointment, I found that I had not lost consciousness and\n",
      "could, in fact, hear him loud and clear. I had landed with one cheek on the\n",
      "ground, and I could feel a couple of knee scrapes begin to gently ooze\n",
      "blood. It was my knees that had given out in the first place, so I figured they\n",
      "deserved whatever they got. It seemed a rather inauspicious time for them\n",
      "to take a lunch break, and I dimly thought I might have a talk with them\n",
      "once we reached Heaven or The Great Calzone in the Sky or wherever\n",
      "people go when they die in Sicily.\n",
      "Mr. Brixton knelt down and rummaged through his briefcase. For a\n",
      "moment, I caught a glimpse of thirty-nine befuddled, fascinated teenage\n",
      "faces pressed against the glass windows of a luxury air-conditioned motor\n",
      "coach. Then he stood up again, blocking my view with a large map.\n",
      "“There’s a hospital about seven kilometers away,” he said. “I took a\n",
      "traveler there two summers ago when he had a heart attack.”\n",
      "“Shit,” said Mr. D’Angelo, scratching his head. He held my wrist for a\n",
      "few moments. “Well, she’s not having a heart attack.”\n",
      "“Probably not,” Mr. Brixton said. “But it’ll be free to visit, and they’re\n",
      "very good.”\n",
      "“Free? You mean, like, they bill you later?”\n",
      "“No, it’s totally free. The man ended up needing surgery and he didn’t\n",

      "“No shit! Is it like that in England, too? Here, sweetheart, see if you can\n",

      "“Better,” I said woozily. “How come the ground keeps moving?”\n",
      "“Oh dear,” said Mr. Brixton.\n",

      "picking a lemon off a nearby tree, halving it, and placing each half on my\n",
      "wrists. I think it was supposed to help with nausea.\n",
      "I also remember Mr. D’Angelo announcing, “All right, kids. Another\n",
      "change of plans. We gotta skip the beach.”\n",
      "An enormous hue and cry arose on the bus.\n",
      "“What the fuck?” Amber shouted. “Why can’t we just drop her off at\n",
      "the hotel and then go?”\n",
      "“We’re not going to the hotel,” Mr. D’Angelo replied. “We’re going to\n",
      "the hospital.” He paused. “Now sit down and shut up.” There was a steely\n",

      "would have terrified me if I hadn’t been off floating in some la-la land\n",
      "beyond fear. It was very quiet now inside my head. My mind had detached\n",
      "from my body, and any sensation I felt—the tingling, sweating, shaking—\n",
      "seemed to be happening to someone else. My thoughts moved through mud.\n",
      "If I’d been able to string two coherent ideas together, I might have\n",
      "wondered just what sort of hospital I was about to visit. Sicily is not\n",
      "generally known as the epicenter of First World medical care. I sincerely\n",

      "also fairly sure no one else of any other nationality has ever uttered these\n",
      "words.\n",
      "Had I been capable of such imaginative thought, I might have\n",
      "envisioned an open-roofed shack with walls woven of leaves and vines. Atoothless, wrinkled old brown strega would sit out front with a shotgun, a\n",

      "What I got instead was a modern facility with a roof, doors, and\n",
      "electricity—the whole works. Uniformed nurses brought a wheelchair to the\n",
      "door as soon as the bus rumbled to a stop. Mr. Brixton, Mr. D’Angelo, and\n",
      "the driver helped a nurse load me into the chair. The driver returned to the\n",

      "tonight!”\n",
      "“Can he put the A/C on, at least?” one of the boys asked. The air was\n",
      "deadly still and oppressively hot.\n",

      "I remember swiftly gliding into the hospital, which was smaller than the\n",

      "being in that wheelchair just seemed wrong, like I was taking up a real sick\n",
      "person’s space. Even in my hazy daze, I felt like a fraud. I was going to die,\n",
      "sure, but they shouldn’t waste the wheels on me. They could just lay me out\n",
      "someplace. Maybe they could hook me up with a blanket and a stuffed\n",
      "animal and just let me expire quietly.They did lay me out soon enough on an examining table in a room with\n",
      "spotless steel cabinets and bright overhead lights. A circle of faces peered\n",
      "down at me—Mr. D’Angelo, Mr. Brixton, and no fewer than three\n",
      "suspiciously attractive nurses, each of whom wore bigger hair and more\n",
      "makeup than I’d ever seen on a nurse back home in New Jersey (no small\n",
      "feat, incidentally). Someone took my pulse. Someone else shined a small\n",
      "flashlight in my eyes. A third someone looked at my tongue. I should have\n",
      "told one of them that I was on prescription medication, but my remaining\n",
      "shred of vanity stilled my voice. Besides, I was about to die. That secret\n",
      "could die with me.\n",
      "“I suppose we ought to give her some space,” Mr. Brixton whispered to\n",
      "Mr. D’Angelo.\n",
      "“You’re gonna be fine, kiddo,” Mr. D’Angelo said. He patted my hand.\n",
      "“Don’t worry.” The sudden fatherly gesture of caring made a lump swiftly\n",
      "rise in my throat. I felt tears prick the back of my eyes, and had the vague\n",
      "realization that the body to which I was loosely attached was going to begin\n",
      "crying.\n",
      "I stared up at the lights, blinking. The faces moved away, and the nurses\n",
      "spoke to one another in lovely-sounding syllables that I could not decipher.\n",
      "Soon, I could barely hear them anymore. My ears were shutting down. I\n",
      "was relieved to realize that my body was giving up.\n",
      "Maybe I could just fall asleep here and not wake up ever.\n",
      "Then came a sudden whoosh of cold air and a great crashing sound as\n",
      "the examining room door burst open. The energy around me changed\n",
      "suddenly, became electrified. I saw, without seeing, that Mr. Brixton and\n",
      "Mr. D’Angelo stood up straighter. Slowly, I turned my head to the side and\n",
      "gazed for the first time upon Dr. Sophia Loren.\n",
      "That wasn’t her actual name, of course. I don’t think I ever got her real\n",
      "name. What I got was the same eyeful Mr. Brixton and Mr. D’Angelo were\n",
      "getting: a stunning, deeply tanned olive-skinned woman with huge, luscious\n",
      "clouds of shining brown hair, giant, heavily made-up eyes, pouty lips, and\n",
      "va-va-va-voom cleavage that owed its perkiness to nature, a well-\n",
      "constructed push-up bra, or a talented surgeon. She wore a tight purple V-\n",
      "neck shirt and a black miniskirt beneath an open white lab coat. I dimly\n",
      "noted her large gold hoop earrings and three-inch-high black stilettos.\n",
      "Then she whipped out a pair of black-rimmed glasses that looked more\n",
      "like a prop than a necessity, and it dawned on me that I had unwittinglywandered onto the set of a porno movie. There was nothing about the\n",
      "scenario that didn’t scream adult film, down to the bevy of hot chicks in\n",
      "nurse costumes. Out of deep-seated Catholic guilt and terror, I had long\n",
      "resisted my occasional feelings of sexual attraction toward women. But in\n",
      "my weakened state, I found myself vaguely turned on.\n",
      "Then Mr. D’Angelo opened his mouth and promptly took the wind out\n",

      "“HELLO. ARE YOU THE DOCTOR?” he asked in the loud, slow\n",
      "voice that Americans reserve for non–English speakers (as if screaming in a\n",

      "A hush again fell over the room. Mr. D’Angelo shut his mouth. Mr.\n",
      "Brixton uttered not a peep. Even the three lovely nurses were completely\n",
      "quiet. Had this been a BDSM porno, it would have been clear who was the\n",
      "dom and who were the subs.\n",
      "Dr. Sophia’s eyes came to rest on me, and she raised an eyebrow\n",
      "slightly. Regally, she held out her hand. A nurse quickly skittered up and\n",
      "gave her a clipboard and a chart. Dr. Sophia looked down at it, frowned\n",
      "slightly, and approached the table slowly, with her head cocked slightly to\n",
      "one side. She was wearing a significant amount of perfume, and her scent\n",
      "reached me before she did. She smelled like the most annoying part of a\n",
      "department store, but on her it was somehow sexy. With a body and a face\n",
      "like that, she probably could’ve carried off Eau de Raw Sewage.\n",
      "Then she was right beside me, staring at me with an emotionless,\n",
      "analytical curiosity. I felt like a crossword puzzle. She bent down low, then\n",
      "even lower, until her face was mere inches from my own and the scent of\n",
      "her perfume threatened to overwhelm my nostrils. We locked eyes for a\n",
      "long moment.\n",
      "I blinked first.\n",
      "“Homesick!” she exclaimed in lightly accented English, straightening\n",
      "bolt-upright. Behind me, I sensed Mr. D’Angelo and Mr. Brixton jump in\n",
      "tandem.“Sedative!” she ordered, scribbling something on the clipboard and\n",
      "handing it back to a nurse. Within a minute, a nurse handed me a cup of a\n",
      "yellow liquid and a cup of water.\n",
      "I drank the yellow stuff, which tasted bitter and astringent, and then the\n",
      "water. Dr. Sophia smiled broadly and touched me for the first time. It was\n",
      "probably too early for the yellow stuff to have begun to work, but I felt a\n",
      "narcotic sense of calm wash over me.\n",
      "“Better now,” she said, smoothing some hair back from my forehead.\n",
      "“You go rest, take deep breaths, walk by the ocean. No stress!”\n",

      "“No stress!” she said firmly, glaring at them.\n",
      "“No stress!” Mr. Brixton replied promptly. Mr. D’Angelo nodded\n",
      "mutely.\n",
      "And then the queen swept out of the room, followed swiftly by her three\n",
      "ladies-in-waiting. It was as if none of them had even been there at all.\n",
      "The room was silent for a few moments. Then Mr. D’Angelo said, “And\n",

      "“Completely,” said Mr. Brixton. “Of course, they pay very high taxes to\n",
      "fund it.”\n",
      "“See, that I wouldn’t like,” Mr. D’Angelo said.\n",
      "I sat upright and grinned at both of them.\n",

      "Let’s go back to the hotel and call your mom and dad. And you just take it\n",
      "easy for the rest of the day, okay? No stress.”\n",
      "“No stressssss!” I chirped, smiling at the cabinets.\n",

      "“They? Who’s they?”\n",
      "“Terrorists! Crazy sons of bitches!”\n",

      "He was right, and I did.\n",
      "School was open the next day. I went, but I didn’t go very often after\n",
      "that. My fear of going outside really had very little to do with the\n",
      "hijackings. In fact, seeing the entire nation gripped by fear made me feel\n",
      "more normal, somehow. For the first time, the world outside my head\n",
      "seemed as irrational and terrified as the world inside my head. And there\n",
      "was a world inside my head—there was the Thing, of course, and then there\n",
      "were the people I invented to help me when I was really feeling awful. One\n",
      "of them looked and sounded like my grandmother, but with an Irish accent,\n",
      "and she was always baking bread. Another one was some sort of Italian-\n",
      "American uncle with a Jersey accent, but he didn’t last long. He was very\n",
      "encouraging, though. And then, of course, there was my own chattering,\n",
      "worried inner monologue, which never ceased, except when I slept.\n",
      "I started sleeping a lot.\n",
      "Sleep was my respite and my vacation. I loved sleeping. I loved the\n",
      "moment of dropping off into unconsciousness, even when it brought\n",
      "nightmares. I would wake up, frightened, but then the Irish grandmother’s\n",
      "voice would sing me a lullaby and tell me that everything was going to be\n",
      "all right, and I’d relax back into slumber. I got really good at sleeping for\n",
      "long stretches of time. Years later, I would have a counselor who\n",
      "participated in super-marathons, running for one hundred miles over several\n",
      "days. I was like that, but with sleep. Marathoners learn certain tricks to keep\n",
      "themselves going, and super-marathoners become even more expert in the\n",
      "art of endurance. I learned that a good night’s sleep—twelve to eighteen\n",
      "hours—could, in fact, be achieved without the use of sleeping pills. (I\n",
      "disdained sleeping pills as harmful chemicals. Because I enjoyed such ahealthy, natural lifestyle.) The number-one key to eliminating obstacles to\n",
      "sleep was to eliminate excess energy in the body—the sort of mindless juice\n",
      "that led to time-wasters like showering and answering phone calls. And the\n",
      "number-one cause of energy in my body was food. So I stopped eating it.\n",
      "An ingenious fix, really, and one that worked brilliantly.\n",
      "There is a unique and insidious delight to denying oneself readily\n",
      "available nutrition. I imagine this is quite different from being starved by\n",
      "some horrid outside force—a bad harvest, an occupying army, a modeling\n",
      "agent. I have led a life of comfort and privilege, with a roof over my head\n",
      "and a loaf of bread within easy distance. To deny myself my favorite foods\n",
      "—to deny myself any food—was to wield control over a part of my body\n",
      "that challenged me each day to sate its needs. I could not control my brain,\n",
      "or my soul, or whatever it was that demanded I wrap myself in blankets and\n",
      "rock back and forth a prescribed number of times before daring to fetch a\n",
      "glass of water. But I could control what I put in my body.\n",
      "I don’t know if I had an eating disorder in the traditional sense, but I\n",
      "think I can understand a little of the anorexic mindset. People with eating\n",
      "disorders appreciate the absolute pleasure of watching their flesh shrink\n",
      "against the bone. Yes, weight-loss champions on reality television shows\n",
      "testify about the joy of going from a size fourteen to a size six, how they\n",
      "learned to eat healthful meals and how they’ve grown to love exercise, but\n",
      "that’s not the sort of reduction I mean. The pain of self-denial turns\n",
      "exquisite when you feel the points of your hip bones pressing against thin\n",
      "skin. As my grades tumbled and my waking hours shrank, as my crowd of\n",
      "friends diminished and my garbage pile rose higher, I lay beneath layers of\n",
      "quilts and felt myself getting smaller and smaller. Shrinking was wonderful.\n",
      "And I was watching myself disappear.\n",
      "I did eat, a little bit, sometimes. I had dwindling food supplies, but\n",
      "occasionally hunger would drive me to open up a year-old can of beans or\n",
      "scrape the mold off a piece of bread. I didn’t get too down on myself for\n",
      "eating, because it wasn’t adding more substance to my body and it certainly\n",
      "wasn’t giving me any of the dreaded energy. When I ate, I nibbled in bed\n",
      "and thought about dying.\n",
      "Lying in bed was vastly preferable to moving about my apartment,\n",
      "which had, unfortunately, turned into a hotbed of conflict. This was mainly\n",
      "due to the hostility of certain objects in my home. For example, the\n",
      "television stared at me plaintively, begging to be turned on when I mostdefinitely did not want to turn it on. Television fried your brain and made\n",
      "you do stupid things, as I explained to it at three A.M. one morning. The\n",
      "answer was apparently not to its satisfaction, because the TV copped an\n",
      "attitude that made me feel weird whenever I looked at it. I covered it with a\n",
      "tie-dyed cloth so that I wouldn’t have to look at it anymore. I had a similar\n",
      "altercation with my computer, which also earned itself a drop cloth.\n",
      "It wasn’t that these appliances actually spoke to me out loud or anything\n",
      "crazy like that. It was more of a vibe. You know when you know someone\n",
      "at work doesn’t like you, even though they’ve never said anything explicitly\n",
      "rude to you? It was like that. My household objects were giving off bad\n",
      "vibes. And pretty soon I realized that the Thing that sat on my shoulder had\n",
      "somehow managed to take over my bathroom, which was when I had to\n",
      "break things off with the toilet and start pissing in cereal bowls. Thankfully,\n",
      "the lack of solid food in my system made defecation a rarity.\n",
      "By the time I started squatting over bowls and peeing, I was too\n",
      "enmeshed in my own half-imagined new world to stop and wonder whether\n",
      "it was a healthy activity. It was just something I did, like turning on the\n",
      "same CD as soon as I woke each day (or night, depending) and playing the\n",
      "same song over and over until I fell asleep again a few hours later. Because\n",
      "I was a white girl from suburban New Jersey, my omnipresent musical\n",
      "companion was the Dave Matthews Band. In the waning days of the fall\n",
      "semester, I listened to their hit single “Satellite” countless times. The\n",
      "repetition was soporific, and guided me through the terrible few hours when\n",
      "sleep simply would not come.\n",
      "One December evening, there came a loud banging at my door. It was\n",
      "rather like the indelicate door-knocking of stern detectives on television cop\n",
      "shows. None of my friends had called or shown up in some time, since it\n",
      "had become abundantly clear I wasn’t going to answer voice-mail messages\n",
      "or emerge from my increasingly noxious lair. I spoke to my parents on\n",
      "occasion, always briefly. I’d claim I was in a hurry to get to class or a party,\n",
      "and then I’d hang up the phone and crawl back into bed. So the combination\n",
      "of shock at the knocking and concern regarding its cause actually propelled\n",
      "me out of bed and to my door. I opened it up, and came face-to-face with\n",
      "Alexandra.\n",
      "I had two best friends at Emerson College, and Alexandra was one of\n",
      "them. She was a talented comedic actress and a trained dancer, and she had\n",
      "excellent strawberry-blond curls and a strikingly beautiful face. She camefrom a colorful Jewish family of singers and writers and musicians, and she\n",
      "had been to faraway places like Bali and Arizona. Everyone wanted to\n",
      "know her or make out with her, but she was sparing about allowing either\n",
      "privilege. I was not so selective with my favors, and I always admired her\n",
      "restraint. She was often as bound up with tension as I, but she dealt with it\n",
      "through dance, comedy, acting, and sushi.\n",
      "She also had another strong passion, and it was this aspect of her\n",
      "personality that must have roared most loudly within her when that door\n",
      "swung open: Alexandra loved cleaning. She did it every day. It stopped just\n",
      "shy of a compulsion, and instead manifested as both a hobby and a great\n",
      "talent. Her room was always meticulously well-ordered. She swept, she\n",
      "dusted, she polished, she vacuumed. And in so doing, she created a\n",
      "welcoming personal space that was as lovely as it was unpretentious. Her\n",
      "place was resplendent with little Buddhas, her friends’ black-and-white\n",
      "photography, reproductions of Victorian fairy paintings, books and rings\n",
      "and smooth stones and beads and tiny beautiful abstract sculptures. Her\n",
      "home was never cluttered, dirty, or unfriendly.\n",
      "It is also a fact that Alexandra detested peppers with an intense hatred.\n",
      "Freshman year, our friend Christopher thought it would be a great April\n",
      "Fool’s Day prank to squeeze pepper juice in Alexandra’s immaculate\n",
      "clothing drawers and impeccable bed. Another girl in the dormitory, a\n",
      "loudly anti-abortion, conservative, evangelical Christian, thought this was\n",
      "the height of hilarity. When Alexandra entered her room that evening, she\n",
      "froze and sniffed the air, instantly detecting something terribly wrong.\n",
      "When Christopher and the other girl entered and found her trying to hold\n",
      "back a gag as she emptied her underwear drawer, they busted out laughing.\n",
      "Alexandra made friends sparingly and was deeply loyal to those who\n",
      "entered her inner circle. Christopher was one of these; the other girl was\n",
      "not. Alexandra turned her fierce green eyes on the girl and said, “This is\n",
      "exactly as funny as me putting a dead fetus in your bed.” The girl ran off,\n",
      "terrified. Alexandra turned her gaze on Christopher. “I’ll deal with you\n",
      "later,” she said in a low, steady voice. Christopher backed away slowly and\n",
      "hid in his room. Alexandra went out and talked herself down, over brown-\n",
      "rice tea and sashimi.\n",
      "Alexandra’s aversion to general disorder was barely evident when I\n",
      "opened my door, which was a testament to both her love for me and her\n",
      "talent at acting. She told me later that she didn’t know there were bowls ofurine festering under my bed, but I can’t imagine the smell escaped her\n",
      "notice. I know she saw the pile of garbage and the empty soda cans that\n",
      "rolled at my feet, the stained clothes all over the floor and, most of all, my\n",
      "skinny, stinking frame. I hadn’t showered in weeks, and I had been wearing\n",
      "the same urine-stained sweatpants and T-shirt for too many days to count.\n",
      "She met my gaze and didn’t blink. “We’re going out to dinner,” she\n",
      "said. It wasn’t a suggestion.\n",
      "“We are?” I asked, confused.\n",
      "“You should put a coat on, and a scarf. It’s cold.”\n",
      "The only thing that surprised me more than Alexandra’s presence was\n",
      "the fact that I did what she told me to do. I put on a coat, a scarf, and Mary\n",
      "Janes (not generally known to work with sweatpants, but I didn’t really\n",
      "have fashion on the brain) and followed her down the stairs and across the\n",
      "street to a Malaysian restaurant we’d often admired from afar, back when I\n",
      "was normal.\n",
      "We sat down and stared at one another for a moment.\n",
      "“So what’s been going on with you?” she said. “I haven’t seen you in\n",
      "forever, and I don’t even know what you’re up to. How’s school going?”\n",
      "“Pretty well,” I mumbled, and a waiter appeared with menus.\n",
      "Alexandra ordered a mango lassi. I ordered water.\n",
      "“Don’t you want tea?” Alexandra asked. “You love peppermint tea.\n",
      "They’ve got peppermint tea.”\n",
      "“No, water’s cool.”\n",
      "“Are you sure you don’t want peppermint tea? I’ve seriously never been\n",
      "out with you and seen you not get peppermint tea if it’s on the menu.”\n",
      "Alexandra’s voice was rising to a higher pitch than normal, and a look of\n",
      "confused concern crossed our waiter’s face.\n",
      "“Water’s fine.”\n",
      "“Are you gonna get dinner?”\n",
      "“I’m not hungry.”\n",
      "“Not hungry?” On the last syllable, Alexandra’s voice squeaked to new\n",
      "heights. “They’ve got all your favorite things. Look, they’ve got chicken\n",
      "with mango and coconut. And they’ve got noodles. Did you want noodles?”\n",
      "“I’m fine,” I said mechanically and, for a moment, I wondered how\n",
      "exactly I’d gotten out of my apartment. Had I walked, or floated, or what? It\n",
      "was hard to remember.\n",
      "“I can come back . . .” the waiter said faintly, backing away.“No!” Alexandra snapped. “We will get a plate of noodles and a plate of\n",
      "coconut-mango chicken, and we will share. And some peppermint tea. And\n",
      "no peppers.”\n",
      "“No . . . no peppers? Is someone allergic?”\n",
      "Alexandra turned the full force of her gaze on him. “No . . . peppers.”\n",
      "His eyes widened in fear. “Yes, madam.” He skittered away.\n",
      "She turned and looked at me. “Are you feeling okay? You look really\n",
      "thin.”\n",
      "And for a moment, something dead inside me briefly flared back to life.\n",
      "Out of all the parts of the story—the imaginary people in my head, the\n",
      "pissing in cereal bowls, the lack of showering—it is this part that\n",
      "embarrasses me the most. I’ve told this story on stages in cities from Los\n",
      "Angeles to Oslo, including many places in between, but I’ve never told this\n",
      "part. It’s just too lame to cop to in person.\n",
      "“I did this,” I said, and showed Alexandra the place on my wrist where\n",
      "I’d cut myself earlier that day. I’d done it on purpose, but I hadn’t even\n",
      "broken skin enough to draw blood. I wasn’t a cutter—I always made fun of\n",
      "the goth girls who carved their creepy boyfriends’ names into their arms—\n",
      "but I was bored and I was awake, and it seemed like an interesting\n",
      "experiment. What would that feel like? Would it hurt? I found that it did\n",
      "hurt, but only a tiny bit, and I filed the information away for later use.\n",
      "Now that’s awkward enough, but here’s the truly humiliating part, the\n",
      "piece I’ve never admitted to anyone else—not to my parents, my friends,\n",
      "my therapist, or my very patient audiences: it was a butter knife. A fucking\n",
      "butter knife. What the hell kind of half-assed training-wheels shit is that?\n",
      "I’ve given myself deeper cuts while shaving my legs. It was nothing more\n",
      "than an advanced scratch. It wasn’t even a fully realized effort to hurt\n",
      "myself, much less end my own life. It was pretty much the most pussy\n",
      "attempt at self-destruction ever.\n",
      "But I showed it to Alexandra anyway.\n",
      "Her expression was briefly horrified, and then switched to a look I’d\n",
      "never seen on her face before. It wasn’t totally sad and it wasn’t totally\n",
      "angry and it wasn’t totally worried, but it might have had a little bit of all of\n",
      "these things put together, with something else.\n",
      "“You need help,” she said evenly, lowering her voice. “I don’t know\n",
      "what is happening, but it’s something really bad. You need to tell your\n",
      "parents what’s going on, and go home.”At this, a feeling I hadn’t encountered in a while—defiance—shot up\n",
      "within me like a geyser.\n",
      "“You can’t make me,” I said, except maybe it wasn’t me saying it,\n",
      "exactly.\n",
      "The waiter appeared. “Mango lassi and water?”\n",
      "“In a minute,” Alexandra said, without breaking eye contact with me.\n",
      "“No, I’ve got them right here,” he said.\n",
      "She turned and glared at him.\n",
      "“I’ll come back later,” he said, and disappeared.\n",
      "She turned back to me.\n",
      "“Go home and call your parents,” she said. “Tell them to pick you up.\n",
      "Because if you don’t, I’ll call them. And I don’t care if they get mad at me\n",
      "or you get mad at me.”\n",
      "“I’m twenty-one,” I said, and it came out like a hysterical whine.\n",
      "“Not right now, you’re not,” she said.\n",
      "I rose slowly, and noticed with detached interest that someone had\n",
      "shredded my napkin to bits and rained the pieces on the floor all around my\n",
      "chair. Then I trudged to the door, across the street, up the front stairs, and\n",
      "into my building. Once inside, I slowly ascended two flights of stairs before\n",
      "dropping to my knees to crawl up the third. I was too tired to remain\n",
      "upright. In my room, I accidentally kicked over a bowl of urine.\n",
      "Automatically, I fetched a paper towel and dropped it on the puddle. I\n",
      "watched the dark stain spread across the paper. Then I went to sleep.\n",
      "I awoke three hours later to a ringing phone. My phone hadn’t rung in a\n",
      "long time. For the second time that day, my surprise propelled me forward\n",
      "into an unusual action: I answered the call.\n",
      "“Hello?” I said hoarsely.\n",
      "“Hi, Ra-Ra!” chirped one voice.\n",
      "“Hey, Ra!” boomed another.\n",
      "It was my parents.\n",
      "I had forgotten about my non-dinner conversation with Alexandra, so I\n",
      "couldn’t imagine why they were calling me. Had I been of sounder mind, I\n",
      "might have noticed that the clock read 11:00 P.M., which to suburban\n",
      "middle-aged white people is like 4:00 A.M.: they’re only up at that hour if\n",
      "something very big is going on. In addition, they were both on different\n",
      "extensions in the same house, something parents only do when they call to\n",
      "tell you something awful, like that your older brother knocked up thatterrible girl who works with him at the carwash, or that your grandmother\n",
      "drowned the cat in the bathtub.\n",
      "All these details escaped my attention.\n",
      "“Hey, guys,” I said, and it sort of came out smooshed, like Hayguysss.\n",
      "“How’s everything going, Ra?” my dad asked with a feigned cheer that,\n",
      "again, escaped my notice at the time.\n",
      "“Great,” I mumbled. “Awesome. Really, really good. Like the best.”\n",
      "“Whadja have for dinner?” my mother asked, her voice the same high-\n",
      "pitched mode of perky she used with her elementary school students.\n",
      "I had to lie, because otherwise—otherwise—I couldn’t think past\n",
      "“otherwise,” so I mumbled, “Food. Really good food. Pasta and . . .\n",
      "hamburgers and . . . salad and . . . water and . . . other pasta.” The Thing sat\n",
      "heavy on my shoulder and dug in its claws. “And watermelon ice cream,” I\n",
      "added, inventing a dish that sort of sounded like the kind of interesting thing\n",
      "you’d eat in a city.\n",
      "“You sure, Ra?” my dad asked, and his voice wavered a little.\n",
      "Oh shit, I thought, alarm bells going off in my head. He’s on to me. This\n",
      "dude is psychic! How does he know I’m lying? I said “watermelon ice\n",
      "cream”! That’s too good to be a lie!\n",
      "I thought fast, and came up with the perfect answer to shut him down.\n",
      "“Yeah, I’m sure,” I said, and cleared my throat elaborately.\n",
      "There was a moment of silence on the other end of the line, and my\n",
      "mother piped in. “How’s school going, Ra? You getting good grades?”\n",
      "“Yeah. Yup. Oh, yes,” I said. “Like As . . . Bs . . . one B-minus, because\n",
      "this teacher didn’t understand what I was trying to say, but she’s letting me\n",
      "do it over so . . . I feel pretty awesome about that.” I punctuated every few\n",
      "words with a cough. I realized I hadn’t spoken to them at such length in a\n",
      "very long time. It was surprisingly tiring.\n",
      "“Good grades?” my dad said. “You sure about that, Ra?”\n",
      "Goddammit, I thought. This motherfucker’s good. Maybe he really does\n",
      "have like the eighth sense or whatever. This is getting eerie.\n",
      "“Yeah,” I said.\n",
      "“Ra, is everything okay?” my mom asked, and I relaxed a little. Mom\n",
      "was an easy sell.\n",
      "“Totally,” I said. “I’m pretty busy right now, actually.” I reached out and\n",
      "turned on “Satellite.”\n",
      "“You sure about that, Ra?” she asked.Not her, too! What are these people, wizards? Are they fucking\n",
      "soothsayers or some shit?\n",
      "I jerked my head to the side and caught sight of the paper towel I’d put\n",
      "over the urine spill earlier. It had dried and yellowed. The bowl of piss had\n",
      "been sitting there for two days . . . or maybe it was three, I couldn’t\n",
      "remember. I’d kept telling myself I would wash it out in the sink, but the\n",
      "sink and I were having issues because it was giving off a hostile vibe and I\n",
      "just wasn’t interested in the drama.\n",
      "“You can tell us if something’s wrong, Ra,” my mom said.\n",
      "And then I knew it was over and that they knew everything, even\n",
      "though, really, they didn’t know the half of it. I thought they must be\n",
      "omniscient or something, that they could see all the bowls of pee and the\n",
      "dirty clothes everywhere and the garbage and all the rest.\n",
      "“I don’t think I’m feeling too well, Mommy,” I said. This greatly\n",
      "confused the Thing on my shoulder, which commanded me to commence\n",
      "rocking back and forth. I obeyed.\n",
      "“We didn’t think so, honey,” my mom said. “Would you like us to come\n",
      "pick you up?”\n",
      "My shoulders dropped about a foot, which startled the Thing so much\n",
      "that it disappeared for a moment.\n",
      "“Yes, please,” I said, and I felt something I hadn’t felt in a while—tears,\n",
      "real ones, bubbling up in my eyes.\n",
      "“Your mother will drive up tomorrow, after she’s done with work,” my\n",

      "flecked brown hair and a neat mustache. He was short like me, and he\n",
      "looked around forty even though I knew he must have been in his late\n",
      "fifties. His lively brown eyes were as active and curious as those of a\n",
      "handsome ferret. His pale skin glowed and betrayed no trace of acid peels\n",
      "or face-lifts. But when he smiled and waved, a patchwork of fine lines and\n",
      "tiny wrinkles showed up around his eyes and across his nose. That was\n",
      "natural and kind of nice, actually. I figured all those years of clean, peaceful\n",
      "living had made him look the way he did. He was really rather striking.\n",

      "and surveyed me from head to toe.\n",
      "“What a beauty you are,” he said. “And a good, kind spirit. I can see it.\n",
      "A spirit full of the love of service. You’ve had some hard times, but you are\n",
      "recovering nicely. A heart full of love.”I felt a delicious chill run down my spine. I hadn’t even told him\n",
      "anything about why I’d really dropped out of college. He was obviously\n",
      "super-intuitive and probably some kind of bodhisattva. I wasn’t positive\n",
      "what a bodhisattva was, exactly, but I’d come across the term several times\n",
      "during my scramble to bone up on spiritual stuff before the interview. I had\n",
      "a vague idea that it meant “good spirit” or “saint” or “someone who is sort\n",
      "of like a holy person, maybe.”\n",
      "“Thank you,” I said humbly, bowing my head. “I am so deeply pleased\n",
      "to be here. It is an honor.”\n",
      "“It is,” he agreed. “Now come on inside and meet Arthur and our intern,\n",
      "Jason. I can’t tell you how nice it’ll be to have a woman around after being\n",
      "cooped up with these alpha males for months.” He let out a dry laugh that\n",
      "ended in a cough. “I’m sorry. Still fighting off a cold Jason brought with\n",
      "him. Maybe I can send you down to town for some echinacea later in the\n",
      "day. We’ve got one decent grocery store that stocks what I need.”\n",
      "“Of course! I’d love to help.” He used herbs for healing, just like the\n",
      "Stevie Nicks witch had done! I finally understood what people meant when\n",
      "they said that life comes full circle. This was so cool.\n",
      "We went into the house, which had all the trappings of a normal abode\n",
      "—floors, walls, windows—but was obviously a gathering place for humans\n",
      "from this world and spirits from the great beyond. First, it smelled like\n",
      "delicious tea and soothing incense. Second, I’d never seen so many\n",
      "religious icons in my life. Every available inch of the interior was adorned\n",
      "with special spiritual knickknacks. Edgar helpfully explained as we went\n",
      "along.\n",
      "“Here’s a framed original poster by our friend James, who is a famous\n",
      "artist. You may have heard of him. He has his own gallery in Chelsea. He\n",
      "took the Four Noble Truths and painted images of four Hollywood\n",
      "celebrities who epitomize each truth. The first one, ‘Life means\n",
      "suffering’—that’s Marilyn Monroe, over here on the lotus. She was so\n",
      "beautiful and she suffered so much for it. Men used her like a towel, and\n",
      "once she was dirtied up they threw her away.” Edgar shook his head and\n",
      "sighed. I sighed to match him.\n",
      "“ ‘The origin of suffering is attachment’—that’s Jim Morrison, on the\n",

      "for it. He visited us once here before he died. He wrote a poem for me. All\n",
      "the other folks here were very jealous. I found him insufferable.”My mouth hung open in shock. “Jim Morrison was here? And he wrote\n",
      "a poem for you?”\n",
      "He nodded solemnly. “I was quite gorgeous when I was younger.” He\n",
      "smiled gently. “Stevie Nicks visited us, and we connected on such a deep\n",
      "level. She really considered me a dear friend for a time. And here she is as\n",
      "the third noble truth, riding the unicorn. I’ve always liked how the white\n",
      "fringe on her scarf matches the unicorn’s mane.”\n",
      "This was just too much. There was Stevie Nicks, looking just like the\n",
      "Stevie Nicks witch and the actual Stevie Nicks.\n",
      "“The third noble truth teaches us that the cessation of suffering is\n",
      "attainable.” Edgar gazed at the painting and smiled softly. “Sometimes, of\n",
      "course, you have to break free of controlling men in order to do it. And\n",
      "Stevie did. She finally, finally did.”\n",
      "“Steve Nicks was the sound track to my youth,” I said reverently. I’d\n",
      "listened to Fleetwood Mac’s live reunion album all through the summer\n",
      "between eleventh and twelfth grades.\n",
      "Edgar smiled benevolently. “She was the sound track to mine, too,” he\n",
      "said.\n",
      "“Does she still visit?”\n",
      "“Oh, no,” Edgar said, laughing. “I can’t stand her.”\n",
      "“Um. Oh.”\n",
      "“Now, the fourth noble truth is the cessation of suffering,” he said. “And\n",
      "of course the only true cessation of suffering is death. So here we have\n",
      "Audrey Hepburn, who became a living saint at the end of her life. But\n",
      "before that, she endured the deprivations of the Holocaust and, even worse,\n",
      "the emotional abuse of several husbands. At least one of them cheated on\n",
      "her. Can you imagine anyone cheating on Audrey Hepburn?”\n",
      "I was aghast. “But she was so pretty!”\n",
      "Edgar suddenly looked very angry. “Yes, she was pretty, Sara!” he\n",
      "snapped. “But more than that, she was a human being with feelings. And\n",
      "there is nothing people hate so much as a kind spirit who knows who she is\n",
      "and will not apologize for it. She was too nice. They walked all over her.\n",
      "Are you going to let them walk all over you, Sara? Are you?” I shrank back.\n",
      "He looked irritated almost to the point of genuine anger.\n",
      "Then, as if someone had flipped a switch, he softened and smiled. “So\n",
      "that’s the painting by James. He’s lovely. Gay, of course. A really nice guy.\n",
      "He’d love you. He adores me.”The storm appeared to be over. I relaxed.\n",
      "“He’s very talented,” I said tentatively, and he nodded with great\n",
      "enthusiasm.\n",
      "“I knew you and I would get along. I see so much of myself in you.” He\n",
      "stared deep into my eyes, and I met his gaze and beamed. I was too flattered\n",
      "to point out that we’d met less than ten minutes prior and that I wasn’t even\n",
      "sure he knew my surname yet.\n",
      "It took nearly an hour just to get through what might have been called\n",
      "the living room in a normal house. I had no idea that so many things could\n",
      "be carved from soapstone. Gold was also well-represented, as were silver,\n",
      "brass, copper, paper, yarn, and cloth. That room alone contained a gift\n",
      "appropriate for every imaginable wedding anniversary.\n",
      "We went through the rest of the house, including Edgar and Arthur’s\n",
      "meditation room, their bedroom, the spare bedroom, the upstairs bathroom,\n",
      "the downstairs bathroom, the playroom (“Sometimes guests bring children,\n",
      "though I discourage it”), Arthur’s office (“His inner sanctum—I’m barely\n",
      "allowed in here”), and the mudroom, where a mouse rattled about inside a\n",
      "cage trap (“It’s a compassionate trap. We don’t kill animals here. We’ll let\n",
      "him out in a field later.”). By the time we reached the kitchen, my mind\n",
      "swam with beads, statues, and tie-dye. It was as if the CEO of Pier 1\n",
      "Imports or Bombay Company had entered the house and exploded.\n",
      "“And now to meet the manly men of the house,” he said as we entered\n",
      "the kitchen. “Boys, meet Sara.”\n",
      "Two men—one my age, one about sixty—looked up from steaming\n",
      "mugs of tea at the kitchen table. The younger man was cute enough, with\n",
      "thick black hair and mournful blue eyes. The older one had clearly once\n",
      "been quite handsome. He remained good-looking, albeit in a creased, faded\n",
      "way. He looked a bit like a fancy, sturdy boat that has been battered by wind\n",
      "and waves over the years. His expression was slightly dazed, but gentle and\n",
      "welcoming.\n",
      "The young man offered his hand. “Hi, I’m Jason,” he said. “I’m the\n",
      "intern.”\n",
      "“We have one every semester,” Edgar said. “Jason is a student at NYU.\n",
      "He helps Arthur with his work for part of the day, and he’s been doing some\n",
      "projects for me around the house, haven’t you, Jason?”\n",
      "A look of terror briefly flickered across Jason’s face. He looked down\n",
      "into his tea and murmured, “Yup.”An awkward moment of silence passed.\n",
      "“Well, say something, Arthur!” Edgar said cheerfully. “Aren’t you\n",
      "excited to meet my new assistant?”\n",
      "I looked at Edgar with surprise. I hadn’t even shown him my résumé\n",
      "yet, much less interviewed for the position. He grinned at me. Clearly, I had\n",
      "the job.\n",
      "Arthur peered at me in kind confusion. “Assistant?” he repeated. “Well\n",
      ". . . that sounds very nice. Welcome, Sara. Would you like a cup of tea?”\n",
      "“I’ll offer the tea around here, thank you,” Edgar said quickly. “Sara, sit\n",
      "down and I’ll give you some tea.”\n",
      "I thanked him and sat.\n",
      "Edgar rattled around the kitchen, chattering nonstop about the upcoming\n",
      "annual conference, his plans for the garden, future celebrity guest speakers,\n",
      "and some facts I’d already picked up from the Blessed Sanctuary website.\n",
      "Throughout Edgar’s monologue, Arthur nodded on occasion, blinking very\n",
      "slowly and offering a word or two. My impression was of a brilliant man\n",
      "who had at one time done a lot of acid. Like, a lot. Jason said nothing, and\n",
      "stared into space or into his cup of tea. When Arthur rose slowly and\n",
      "creakily from his chair, Jason looked enormously relieved. He stood up so\n",
      "fast he nearly knocked over his teacup, which was still mostly full. He\n",
      "didn’t exactly run out of the room, but he speed-walked toward Arthur’s\n",
      "office.\n",
      "When the other men were safely out of earshot, Edgar heaved a great\n",
      "sigh of relief and plunked down in the chair beside me.\n",
      "“Isn’t it better with them gone?” he asked. I had no idea how to answer\n",
      "that question, so I sipped my tea.\n",
      "“Some male energy is so disruptive,” he continued. “You’ll see soon\n",
      "enough who really runs this place, and it isn’t my partner. And it certainly\n",
      "isn’t the intern.” He shook his head and looked at me with a level gaze.\n",
      "“Take my advice: don’t fall in love with him. He’s trouble.”\n",
      "I nearly spat out my tea.\n",
      "“I don’t think he’s really my type,” I said, even though he was.\n",
      "“Good,” Edgar said, and smiled. “Now let’s tour the grounds and I’ll tell\n",
      "you about all the things I want you to work on with me.”\n",
      "By the end of the day, I’d gotten a closer look at the contemplation\n",
      "house, though we didn’t enter it. It was designed specifically for whatever\n",
      "celebrity spiritual teacher happened to be in residence at the time. Thisbuilding, like all the others, was funded by wealthy donors. We walked\n",
      "around the house, but didn’t go inside. Edgar explained that the construction\n",
      "of the contemplation house had kicked up so much dust that he couldn’t\n",
      "sleep for a year (I didn’t ask what dust had to do with his slumber), and that\n",
      "while it was quite pretty, he avoided entering it unless he absolutely had to.\n",
      "Apparently the sight of the interior triggered a kind of PTSD. He hated\n",
      "psychiatrists (“Crooks, all of them!”) so he was praying on it. We visited the\n",
      "organic garden, for which he had grand plans, as well as the forest that took\n",
      "up most of the property. We finished our journey in the mudroom, where\n",
      "Edgar picked up the cage that housed the mouse.\n",
      "“We’re going down the road a mile to let it out on a farm,” he informed\n",
      "me as the terrified creature shook in the corner.\n",
      "“Poor little guy,” he said, cooing at him. “I chant to soothe them. Do\n",
      "you know ‘Om mani padme hum’?”\n",
      "“Yes,” I said.\n",
      "“Let’s chant it together then. Om mani padme hum om mani padme\n",
      "hum . . .”\n",
      "“Om mani padme hum,” I joined in whisper. I have a terrible singing\n",
      "voice, and chanting is too close to singing for my comfort.\n",
      "“Om mani padme hum,” he intoned, poking his finger in the cage and\n",
      "waggling it at the creature. “Om mani padme hum om mani padme hum om\n",
      "mani padme—FUCK YOU!” He shrieked and dropped the cage. The mouse\n",
      "squealed.\n",
      "“Oh my God!” I gasped. “Are you okay?”\n",
      "“The fucker bit me! I’m bleeding. I’m fucking bleeding!” He held up\n",
      "his finger, which showed no trace of blood.\n",
      "“Go let it out in the forest!” he screamed. “Let it out in the forest behind\n",
      "the house!” He took off down the hall, yelling for Arthur.\n",
      "I looked at the mouse and the mouse looked at me. I picked up the cage,\n",
      "left the house, and walked about fifty yards up the forested hillside.\n",
      "Everything grew very quiet except for the occasional rustling of a small\n",
      "animal in the brush. It was cold there, but the air was crisp. From my\n",
      "vantage point, I could see into the valley below. The sun shone through the\n",
      "bare winter trees, and the sky was very blue. I had driven here, all by\n",
      "myself. I hadn’t panicked. My belly didn’t hurt. My head didn’t throb. I felt\n",
      "a cool peace wash over me. I could do this—all of it.I knelt down on the near-frozen ground and released the mouse. He\n",
      "skittered away, free of compassionate traps and sacred chants. As I walked\n",
      "back down the hill to the house, I looked up. A hawk was circling overhead,\n",
      "eyeing something. It dove, slicing soundlessly through the frigid air. I\n",
      "turned my eyes back to the house and walked through the mudroom and\n",
      "into the kitchen.\n",
      "Jason the intern was sitting alone in a chair at the table. When I entered,\n",
      "he rose quickly.\n",
      "“He’s gone to bed for the day,” he said in a low tone. “But he says to\n",
      "come back tomorrow the same time if you want the job.” His eyes seemed\n",
      "to flash something at me, but I couldn’t understand what, exactly.\n",
      "I hesitated.\n",
      "“He’ll pay you twenty dollars an hour,” he said. “Cash.”\n",
      "“I’ll be back tomorrow,” I said.\n",
      "Driving home, I turned over the events of the afternoon in my mind.\n",
      "Edgar had certainly behaved in an unusual fashion, but maybe that was just\n",
      "how professional spiritual gurus were. Arthur was odd in his own way, and\n",
      "the intern seemed scared. Maybe Jason was just intimidated by the people\n",
      "who had the power to write the evaluation for his college course. Maybe\n",
      "Jason was shy. Or maybe Jason was the weird one, and Edgar and Arthur\n",
      "were quite normal.\n",
      "I figured I wasn’t really the authority on what was normal and what\n",
      "wasn’t, seeing as I was about two months out from a daily routine that\n",
      "included peeing in bowls. It was hard enough to get a decent job, much less\n",
      "one that involved the spiritual stuff that so fascinated me. And what an\n",
      "awesome wage! I’d be lucky to make half that much anywhere else. I knew\n",
      "I would go back the next day.\n",
      "And go back I did. The next day was less dramatic, with no real or\n",
      "imagined bloodshed. Mostly I followed Edgar around and helped him with\n",
      "chores around the main house. As he showed me the proper way to iron\n",
      "Arthur’s shirts, he told me about his upbringing in a “spiritually bereft”\n",
      "family in Orange County, California. He had tennis lessons and Boy Scouts,\n",
      "but his parents always favored his older sister “because she was pretty.”\n",
      "Edgar turned his attention to more important matters, marching with various\n",
      "student and community groups during the 1960s.\n",
      "“Arthur,” he called into the hallway. “Arthur, who’s the black guy I\n",
      "marched with? The famous one?”“Martin Luther King Jr.!” Arthur called back in his low, pleasant voice.\n",
      "“No, the other one!” Edgar yelled. “The one who got killed.”\n",
      "“Martin Luther King was killed!”\n",
      "“I know that, do you think I’m stupid?! The other one who got killed!”\n",
      "“Malcolm X?” I ventured timidly.\n",
      "“Was he the one in the driveway?” Edgar asked, impatiently tapping his\n",
      "foot.\n",
      "“That was Medgar Evers,” I said. “I think.”\n",
      "“Okay, then it was Malcolm X. I know it was him because the black guy\n",
      "I marched with didn’t die in a driveway.”\n",
      "“I can’t believe you marched with Malcolm X,” I said, some of the first\n",
      "day’s excitement returning to my voice. “I mean, you’ve met everybody!”\n",
      "He nodded solemnly.\n",
      "“And they were all egotistical bastards,” he said. “Every last one of\n",
      "them.”\n",
      "I stared intently at a batik-print cotton shirt and resumed ironing.\n",
      "Days at the Blessed Sanctuary were pretty similar. I helped Edgar\n",
      "complete some menial task, like organizing receipts, cleaning windows, or\n",
      "returning phone calls from people interested in registering for the big\n",
      "upcoming conference. He told me stories from his life, pausing frequently\n",
      "to tell me exactly how I was screwing up the task at hand. I took direction\n",
      "well, and when I corrected my techniques, he’d resume his tale. His stories\n",
      "usually featured a male villain of some sort—the mailman, the building\n",
      "inspector, a professor back in his school days, his father, Arthur.\n",
      "For his part, Arthur stayed mostly out of the way. He was apparently\n",
      "quite a gifted teacher and was much in demand at yoga conferences and\n",
      "sweat lodges around the country. Edgar grumbled frequently about how he\n",
      "could have used more construction work around the house, but Jason stuck\n",
      "close to Arthur’s side. We exchanged few words, but I noticed him peering\n",
      "at me carefully when we passed in the hallway.\n",
      "Then one day, about three weeks after I began working at the Blessed\n",
      "Sanctuary, Jason disappeared. He wasn’t at lunch in the kitchen, or the\n",
      "afternoon tea break. Edgar wasn’t usually interested in answering my\n",
      "questions about anything, but I got up the courage to inquire as to Jason’s\n",
      "whereabouts.\n",
      "“He hated work,” Edgar spat, pounding his fist on the kitchen table.\n",
      "“We had to get rid of him.” Arthur blanched slightly before regaining hisusual dazed composure.\n",
      "“Oh,” I said, and busied myself collecting everyone’s empty teacups.\n",
      "And that was it. No explanation of why, exactly, Jason hated work—or\n",
      "how—or when. His internship, meant to last for the entire second semester\n",
      "of his junior year in college, had been suddenly curtailed. I wondered what\n",
      "that meant for his credits and his progress toward graduation from NYU. I’d\n",
      "been thinking of that kind of thing a lot since I dropped out of Emerson.\n",
      "When Jason was axed, I had to wonder when Edgar’s rage would\n",
      "refocus itself on me. I didn’t have to wait long to find out.\n",
      "One day, Edgar declared that we must load up the back of the pickup\n",
      "truck with junk from the basement—old furniture, out-of-date electronics,\n",
      "broken toys—and drive it all to the dump. He had me add boxes full of old\n",
      "glassware to the load—glass candlesticks, glass vases, ugly glass figurines\n",
      "he didn’t want.\n",
      "On the way to the dump, we stopped at a gas station. He commented to\n",
      "the attendant that the price of gas seemed unreasonably high. (Actually, he\n",
      "said, “Jesus, you’re charging me an arm and a leg here! Are you trying to\n",
      "bankrupt me?!”)\n",
      "“Well,” the man said, “I hear you, sir. But the price of oil these days is\n",
      "pretty crazy. I get a little discount here, and I can barely afford to fill up my\n",
      "own truck. And I’ve got four kids at home, so we’re pinching every penny.”\n",
      "“I do church work,” Edgar announced, apropos of nothing. “I don’t\n",
      "make a lot of money either.” Soon, we roared off.\n",
      "Edgar was fuming. “I don’t need to hear him tell me about his stupid\n",
      "family,” he muttered. “It’s not my fucking fault he decided to have four\n",
      "kids. Four kids! I don’t need to hear his sob story. If he can’t manage his\n",
      "money, that’s his problem. What am I, a goddamned therapist?”\n",
      "“No,” I said. “You’re certainly not that.” I had told Dr. Morrison about\n",
      "the job, but had spared him some of the wackier details of Edgar’s\n",
      "character. Similarly, I hadn’t filled my family in on exactly what went on at\n",
      "the Blessed Sanctuary. My parents would’ve told me I ought to get a more\n",
      "normal job, and my brother would’ve laughed and laughed.\n",
      "When we arrived at the dump, Edgar backed the truck up to a giant\n",
      "Dumpster into which he instructed me to throw everything.\n",
      "“You’re not doing it fast enough,” he complained as I slowly and\n",
      "gingerly removed a rattan chair from the Tetris-like configuration of junk.\n",
      "“We don’t have all day. You need to work harder if you’re going to getanywhere. Faster and harder! I didn’t hire you to be slow!” Nervously, I\n",
      "sped up, pulling things out at a slightly quicker pace.\n",
      "“Be careful!” he warned me. “Don’t break anything near us. But hurry\n",
      "up while you do it!” Again, I quickened my pace, heaving old record\n",
      "players and VCRs into the abyss of that giant metal trashcan. Exasperated,\n",
      "he began pulling items out, too.\n",
      "“Watch what you’re doing!” he shouted as we each grabbed a leg of the\n",
      "same stool. Startled, I whipped my hand back and accidentally jostled the\n",
      "box of glassware. It tipped over, and an old glass vase smashed on the\n",
      "ground beneath us.\n",
      "I knew instantly that I had committed an unforgivable sin. Frightened, I\n",
      "apologized over and over as I bent down to pick up the larger shards with\n",
      "my bare hands. It was going in the trash anyway, but Edgar’s face was red\n",
      "with the kind of rage one might reserve for an insubordinate servant who\n",
      "purposely smashes the entire contents of the cherished family china cabinet.\n",
      "“I’m so sorry, Edgar,” I said again. “It was an accident. I’m really, really\n",
      "sorry.”\n",
      "He was so angry that the bristles of his mustache trembled with rage.\n",
      "“YOU COULD HAVE BLINDED ME!” he screamed, loud enough for\n",
      "the sanitation workers at the dump to peer at us from twenty yards away. “I\n",
      "could be BLIND now! And it would be your fault, and we would sue you,\n",
      "do you know that? We would sue you, and your family would never be able\n",
      "to pay for you to go back to college! I am not paying you to BLIND ME!”\n",
      "He got right in my face, like a badass Southern California high school chola\n",
      "girl spoiling for a fight.\n",
      "“YOU COULD HAVE BLINDED ME!” he screamed again. “What the\n",
      "hell is wrong with you? Are you a fucking idiot?”\n",
      "For a moment, some of my old spunk flared up, and I nearly glared at\n",
      "him.\n",
      "“Actually, Edgar, I could have blinded both of us,” I said. “I was\n",
      "standing here too. It. Was. An. Accident.”\n",
      "I thought he was going to hit me.\n",
      "“Get in the car,” he said through gritted teeth. “And do not speak to me\n",
      "for the rest of the day. I will drive us back and then you will drive home.”\n",
      "Whatever fightin’ Irish or scrappin’ Sicilian spirit I’d summoned\n",
      "quickly dissipated as I sat in the passenger seat and contemplated getting\n",
      "fired. This gig was my chance to show people—my parents, my friends, Dr.Morrison, myself—that I was capable of holding down a job just like a real\n",
      "adult. Having this job meant that I was getting better, that I had a future\n",
      "outside of my parents’ house, that I might even be able to make it back to\n",
      "finish my college degree one day. This job meant I wasn’t a loser anymore,\n",
      "or at least not as big a loser as I’d been when I was afraid to leave my one-\n",
      "room apartment. How would I explain the loss of my job in a way that\n",
      "wouldn’t make me sound like a completely incompetent fool?\n",
      "Edgar unloaded the rest of the crap on his own and then got into the car.\n",
      "He stared straight ahead as we drove the twenty minutes back to the Blessed\n",
      "Sanctuary. When we parked outside the main house, he turned to me and\n",
      "said simply, “I will see you here at the usual time tomorrow.” Then he went\n",
      "into the mudroom.\n",
      "I had prepared myself to be fired right on the spot, so I was a bit\n",
      "confused. Did he want me to return the next day just so he could fire me? If\n",
      "he didn’t get rid of me, would a letter still go in my permanent file? Would\n",
      "Stevie Nicks be notified, and if so, would this preclude my attendance at all\n",
      "future Fleetwood Mac reunion concerts?\n",
      "The next day, I walked with great trepidation through the mudroom and\n",
      "into the kitchen. There I found Edgar with a bright smile on his face. The\n",
      "table was set with a pitcher of milk, a jar of honey, a bowl of raisins, and a\n",
      "pot of tea. Two matching breakfast bowls sat beside two matching teacups.\n",
      "“Sara!” he exclaimed when I entered, clapping his hands and grinning.\n",
      "“We have so much to do today! Come, eat up! We need our strength for the\n",
      "tasks ahead. Can you believe it’s only two weeks until the annual\n",
      "conference?” Warily, I sank into a chair. He ladled a steaming pile of\n",
      "oatmeal into my bowl and handed me a spoon.\n",
      "“I slow-cook it, the way it’s meant to be done,” he told me as he poured\n",
      "me a cup of tea. “Steel-cut Irish oats. Only takes thirty minutes on the stove.\n",
      "I don’t know why people can’t be bothered with it. I find it meditative.\n",
      "Chop wood, carry water, make oatmeal!” He laughed a high-pitched,\n",
      "tinkling laugh. I realized then that while I hadn’t heard Edgar laugh often,\n",
      "I’d never heard him laugh in the same way twice. Something about that\n",
      "really freaked me out.\n",
      "Soon enough, I was too busy to worry much about Edgar’s laughter.\n",
      "Edgar was preoccupied with the logistical preparations of getting three\n",
      "guest speakers to the Blessed Sanctuary from points all over the country. He\n",
      "also had to figure out how much food to buy for the two hundred donorswho would come to the conference for learning and worship. He gave me a\n",
      "list of tasks and basically left me to my own devices for the next two weeks.\n",
      "Early spring was upon us, so I had some weeding to do. I also had to sweep,\n",
      "vacuum, dust, mop, shine, alphabetize, iron, polish, and fold all manner of\n",
      "things in the main house, the contemplation house, and the sweat lodge. I\n",
      "finally got inside the sweat lodge, which proved rather annoying to clean\n",
      "because I had to individually dust all the nooks and crannies of every sacred\n",
      "ritual object (and there were hundreds of them). The mystical thrill of\n",
      "holding a genuine sacred eagle feather really fades when you have to clean\n",
      "forty of those fuckers in an hour.\n",
      "I spent so little time with Edgar in those weeks that I might have almost\n",
      "forgotten how disturbingly unbalanced he was. But in case my memory had\n",
      "grown dim, he saw fit to remind me on the day of the big conference. At\n",
      "least this time his rage was mostly reserved for someone else.\n",
      "My workday usually began at ten A.M. and ended at six P.M. But on the\n",
      "morning of the big conference, I arrived at seven A.M. in order help Edgar\n",
      "set up. When I turned onto the long driveway, I saw that the trees around\n",
      "the property were festooned with bright, brand-new cloth peace symbol\n",
      "flags fluttering in the early-spring breeze. Unlit tiki torches were set on\n",
      "either side of the drive. I assumed these were either a nod to some\n",
      "mysterious hippie-Hawaiian religious connection or else a cheap way to get\n",
      "the party started.\n",
      "I pulled up to the house and saw Arthur puttering in the garden. This\n",
      "was rather unusual, as he didn’t often leave his office.\n",
      "“Hey, Arthur!” I called as I got out of the car. “You ready for all these\n",
      "people?” He was a kind guy, and my impression of him as a sweetly\n",
      "befuddled ex-hippie hadn’t changed.\n",
      "He looked up slowly and blinked in the dim morning light. It seemed to\n",
      "take him a few moments to recognize me. When he did, he smiled his gentle\n",
      "smile.\n",
      "“Hello, Sara,” he said. “I am so glad you are here to help.” There was\n",
      "deep relief in his voice. I walked over to take a look at the garden.\n",
      "“Shoots are finally coming up,” I said. “You’ll have fresh vegetables\n",
      "every day.”\n",
      "He stared at one particular plant for a long time, seemingly mesmerized.\n",
      "“Yes,” he said finally. “Maybe Edgar will like that.” When he said\n",
      "Edgar’s name, we both shivered a little.“I guess I’d better get inside and help him out.”\n",
      "“Oh yes, please, Sara.” There was that immense relief again. “He’s in\n",
      ". . . he’s . . .”\n",
      "“Oh, I bet I know how he is.” Arthur looked at me in surprise, and I\n",
      "grinned at him.\n",
      "I left him there, wandering peacefully among the quietest living things\n",
      "in the world. I felt sorry for the guy. Oh, he wasn’t exactly a henpecked\n",
      "husband. Edgar seemed to treat his partner with more care and dignity than\n",
      "he afforded most people. He capably managed the day-to-day aspects of life\n",
      "with Arthur. I’d seen Edgar pay the bills on time, make healthful and\n",
      "nutritious meals, and keep an eagle eye on his partner’s physical health and\n",
      "work deadlines. I don’t think Arthur was necessarily capable of managing\n",
      "the details on his own, and in Edgar he had an able and energetic partner.\n",
      "They obviously loved each other, and their mutual loyalty was evident. It\n",
      "might even have been a happy union, in its way. But Edgar resented Arthur,\n",
      "and I can’t imagine Arthur didn’t know it. And while I knew Edgar could be\n",
      "overwhelming one on one, I had a feeling he also wasn’t the most adept at\n",
      "coping with large groups of humans.\n",
      "This last bit was reinforced as soon as I stepped into the kitchen. Edgar\n",
      "rushed about the room in a tizzy, his usually perfect hair frizzy and\n",
      "unkempt. I could tell he’d been up much longer than I had, and I’d risen at\n",
      "five thirty A.M.\n",
      "“Good morning,” I said. “Tell me what to do.”\n",
      "“It is a terrible morning, and I will gladly tell you what to do,” Edgar\n",
      "snapped. “I wish you had been here earlier. I should’ve had you sleep over\n",
      "and get up with me at three. We’re hours behind. Hours!”\n",
      "It was ten after seven.\n",
      "“The downstairs bathroom needs to be completely cleaned,” he said.\n",
      "“In the basement? Are you letting people go down there?”\n",
      "“They’ll go all over, Sara! They don’t care that this is our house, that\n",
      "this is our life. They think they paid to have access to everything. They’ll go\n",
      "in our bedroom if I don’t put up a sign. And that’s the next thing I’ll have\n",
      "you do. Cordon off the hallway with tape and put up a sign that says PRIVATE\n",
      "QUARTERS. NO ACCESS! Put an exclamation point at the end. No, put three.\n",
      "Now do the bathroom.”\n",
      "I descended the stairs to the basement, glad to be out of his way. As I\n",
      "disposed of dead flies, dirt, and dried toothpaste, I heard his little feetpounding the floorboards overhead.\n",
      "When I came upstairs thirty minutes later, he’d already put up the tape\n",
      "and the sign. “You took too long!” he said by way of explanation. “Now go\n",
      "to Arthur’s office and photocopy and fold the leaflets up there.”\n",
      "He kept me busy with various tasks all morning. As with all the other\n",
      "work I did for him, none of it was inherently difficult or unpleasant. But as\n",
      "usual, everything I produced wasn’t quite up to his standards. If I folded\n",
      "napkins into triangles, I ought to have folded them into rectangles. If I\n",
      "defrosted frozen fruit in the steel bowl, I ought to have defrosted it in the\n",
      "ceramic bowl. If I greased a pan with olive oil, I ought to have used canola\n",
      "oil. The little criticisms seemed as necessary to his daily routine as the tasks\n",
      "he had assigned me. He inspected the basement bathroom and redid all my\n",
      "work. I wanted to point out that none of the guests were likely to use the\n",
      "shower, but kept mum as he scrubbed the grout I’d already attacked with an\n",
      "old toothbrush.\n",
      "The day’s program was set to begin at noon, but the guest speakers were\n",
      "to show up at ten A.M. There arrived in due course a local rabbi, a local\n",
      "minister, and a writer named Elizabeth. She edited the religion section of a\n",
      "well-regarded newspaper and made not-infrequent appearances on\n",
      "television to discuss the ways in which Eastern spirituality had penetrated\n",
      "the mainstream American consciousness. What intrigued me the most was\n",
      "that she was a product of the 1960s-era Blessed Sanctuary where Arthur and\n",
      "Edgar had fallen in love. She had lived with them, eaten with them, and\n",
      "worked with them for a couple of years. Her sister Mary had also stayed at\n",
      "the place for a time, and Edgar had wondered aloud in passing if Mary\n",
      "would also return for this year’s conference. It was hard for me to imagine\n",
      "that Edgar had existed in any form other than his current one, and I longed\n",
      "to hear stories of his youth from a surviving witness. Was it possible that\n",
      "he’d actually mellowed over the years?\n",
      "I was out in the woods stringing extra peace symbol flags between trees\n",
      "when I distantly heard a car’s tires crunch over the loose gravel near the\n",
      "house. By the time I emerged near the back of the house, the guests were\n",
      "out of the car, laughing warmly and greeting Arthur.\n",
      "I rounded the corner of the house and saw an attractive, hippie-chic\n",
      "older woman with well-maintained silver hair that shone in the midmorning\n",
      "sun. She wore a nicely tailored gray suit accessorized with some sort of\n",
      "ethnic-print lavender scarf and tasteful chunky silver jewelry, and hermakeup was subtle but perfect. Her companion was similarly attired and\n",
      "resembled her too strongly not to be her sister.\n",
      "What I found the most remarkable was Arthur, who stood chatting\n",
      "amiably with the two women. He wasn’t animated, exactly, but he certainly\n",
      "showed more energy than the slow-moving fellow I was used to watching\n",
      "sip tea each morning at the kitchen table.\n",
      "When I got close enough, Arthur introduced me to Elizabeth and her\n",
      "sister Mary as “Edgar’s assistant.”\n",
      "“Well, that must be quite a job,” Elizabeth said dryly.\n",
      "I was shocked and sort of delighted to see Arthur laugh. I hadn’t even\n",
      "considered the possibility that he was capable of laughter.\n",
      "“You can imagine,” he said. “Edgar works very hard.”\n",
      "“Yes, of course,” Elizabeth said faintly, looking past us. Arthur and I\n",
      "turned around to see Edgar barreling down the front lawn at a near-run. His\n",
      "face wore a smile so forced it nearly qualified as a grimace.\n",
      "“Elizabeth! Mary! You’re finally here!” Now Edgar was upon us, and\n",
      "Arthur had shrunk back into himself. He seemed to find a nearby butterfly\n",
      "utterly captivating.\n",
      "“We were beginning to wonder if you’d forgotten about us,” Edgar\n",
      "added, putting his hands on his hips and forcing that smile even wider.\n",
      "“Oh no, are the others here already?” Mary said apologetically.\n",
      "“Not yet,” Edgar said. “You’re all late!”\n",
      "“So we’re first,” Elizabeth said.\n",
      "“Well, yes,” Edgar conceded. He paused and then looked at me.\n",
      "“Elizabeth, this is my assistant, Sara,” he announced.\n",
      "“We’ve met,” I said. I caught Mary looking at me with great sympathy.\n",
      "“Yes,” Elizabeth said. “Now Edgar, dear, did you want me to set up\n",
      "inside the contemplation house? Mary is here to help. She may be a\n",
      "businesswoman today, but she’s still got some of that Blessed Sanctuary\n",
      "spirit in her.” Unexpectedly, Edgar linked his arm through Elizabeth’s and\n",
      "led her away, chattering eighteen miles a minute about the plans for the day.\n",
      "The two got about ten feet toward the temple before Edgar halted and\n",
      "turned.\n",
      "“You too, Mary!” he called. “I don’t want my personal assistant telling\n",
      "you stories about what a horrible boss I am!” He let loose one of his\n",
      "unsettling laughs. This time it took the form of a cackle. Some things are\n",
      "funny because they’re true. Perhaps in Edgar’s head this was one of those,but I doubt it. He was smart, but he didn’t possess sufficient self-awareness\n",
      "to realize that he was a tiny gay nightmare. I certainly didn’t give him any\n",
      "indication that I was unhappy. Twenty dollars an hour bought a lot of my\n",
      "tolerance. I even laughed gamely as Mary crept away.\n",
      "The rabbi and the minister arrived in a car together, and they were as\n",
      "jolly as Elizabeth had been reserved. They wanted a tour of the grounds in\n",
      "order to see the improvements Edgar and Arthur had made since last year,\n",
      "and I took them around quickly, pointing out the expanded garden, the\n",
      "newly painted contemplation house, and all the new peace symbol flags.\n",
      "Edgar returned from the contemplation house with Elizabeth and Mary in\n",
      "tow. He embraced the rabbi and the minister with an enthusiasm that had\n",
      "been lacking in his greeting of the two women. Arthur wandered outside\n",
      "and immediately plunged into deep conversation with the new visitors and\n",
      "Edgar.\n",
      "Elizabeth approached me with a folder in hand.\n",
      "“Sara, do you think you might be able to photocopy these for me?” she\n",
      "asked politely. “I need two hundred copies for the visitors.” I looked up into\n",
      "her sparkling blue eyes and found myself immediately eager to please. This\n",
      "woman had an intimidating charm and an undeniable magnetism. I could\n",
      "see why she was such a successful figure in her field. There was just\n",
      "something about her that made you want to pay attention. And she smelled\n",
      "like the slightest dab of some wonderful, expensive perfume.\n",
      "“I’d be glad to help,” I said. “I can copy them in Arthur’s office.”\n",
      "“Oh, thank you so much,” she said, and a genuine smile broke over her\n",
      "face. It was like the sudden emergence of the sun on a cool, pleasantly quiet\n",
      "gray day. I hurried into the house.\n",
      "It takes a bit of time to make two hundred copies on a small, antiquated\n",
      "photocopy machine in a home office. I was only halfway through the task\n",
      "when I heard the first paying guests arrive. Immediately after I noted the car\n",
      "sounds, I noted a much louder, much nearer sound. It was getting closer,\n",
      "and closer, and closer and—BOOM!\n",
      "Edgar flung open the door. His face was redder than I’d ever seen it, and\n",
      "he looked angrier even than the day I’d dropped the vase at the dump.\n",
      "Oh, fuck, I thought. He is so going to fire me this time. How am I gonna\n",
      "explain this to my parents? They’re gonna think I can’t hold down a job.\n",
      "They’re gonna think I’m still crazy and a baby. I didn’t know what thereason would be, but Edgar didn’t really need a reason to scream at\n",
      "anybody. Rage was his default setting.\n",
      "Instead of screaming, he hissed.\n",
      "“What the fuck are you doing up here?”\n",
      "“Making copies for Elizabeth.” My voice was very small.\n",
      "Unconsciously, I braced for an actual physical attack.\n",
      "“Making copies for Elizabeth?” Instead of getting louder as I’d\n",
      "expected, his voice got lower and lower. “And who the fuck told you to do\n",
      "that?”\n",
      "“She did.”\n",
      "“She did!”\n",
      "I gulped. Edgar’s face remained frozen in a kind of immovable fury. I\n",
      "scrambled to explain my apparent sin.\n",
      "“I’m sorry. I thought it was part of my job, to help you out by doing\n",
      "little things for the guest speakers. So you wouldn’t have to be bothered\n",
      "with them.” Outside, the voices of visitors grew louder. More cars were\n",
      "pulling into the driveway each minute.\n",
      "Edgar looked hard at me.\n",
      "“I want you to understand that I am not angry with you,” he said very\n",
      "carefully, as if he were afraid he’d choke on the words. “I am not upset with\n",
      "you. This is what she does. This is how she operates. She manipulated you\n",
      "into thinking you were helping me, because you love me.” I wasn’t about to\n",
      "object to that last bit, so I nodded and he went on.\n",
      "“Elizabeth must be the center of attention at all times. She must feel that\n",
      "everyone worships her.” Edgar was pacing now, slightly bent at the waist,\n",
      "with his hands grasped together behind his back. “She was the same way\n",
      "when we all lived together thirty-five years ago. She was Queen Elizabeth,\n",
      "and her sister was Queen Mary, and we were their worthless subjects.\n",
      "Arthur was patient with Elizabeth because she was very beautiful, and even\n",
      "gay men are easily controlled by beautiful women. I don’t mean to imply\n",
      "that anything happened between them. He was captivated by me. Utterly\n",
      "captivated. And he hasn’t been with a woman since college.” I nodded\n",
      "again.\n",
      "“But that is just the way women like Elizabeth work. They pretend to be\n",
      "feminists and peaceniks and Buddhists or whatever you want to call them,\n",
      "but they’re actually weak and selfish creatures. They cannot abide another\n",
      "person having any power. She saw that I was a successful businessman andnonprofit director with my own personal assistant, and she wanted to co-opt\n",
      "you for her own needs. To show me that I’m still beneath her. To show me\n",
      "that she is the queen. Well, would you like to hear something, Sara?” I\n",
      "nodded for the third time, as if I were in a trance.\n",
      "Edgar rose up with all his might and gazed at me with the fury of Kali,\n",
      "Mother-Destroyer (if Kali wore Birkenstocks with thick gray socks).\n",
      "“I am the queen of this kingdom,” he declared, throwing his chin up and\n",
      "squaring his shoulders. “Princess Elizabeth will never take that from me.”\n",
      "He kept staring at me. I searched desperately for a proper response.\n",
      "“Well, you look much younger than she does,” I offered weakly.\n",
      "“Sara, don’t be superficial,” Edgar said. “That’s your generation’s\n",
      "greatest weakness. You only care about what’s on the exterior. In the sixties,\n",
      "we concerned ourselves with greater things.”\n",
      "“I’m sorry.”\n",
      "“Don’t apologize. You apologize all the time. It’s the mark of a woman\n",
      "who doesn’t know who she is.”\n",
      "“Well, you’re right about that,” I agreed pleasantly. “Would you like me\n",
      "to start the coffee for the guests?”\n",
      "“You haven’t started the coffee yet? What am I paying you for? Go do\n",
      "it, now!”\n",
      "I abandoned Elizabeth’s photocopies and scurried down to the kitchen,\n",
      "where I hid for most of the remainder of the day. I churned out more tea and\n",
      "coffee than an entire kingdom could consume. The two hundred now-\n",
      "enlightened middle-aged white people who filed through at lunch left more\n",
      "caffeinated than was probably legal. I served them with an obsequious\n",
      "manner, taking care to offer them an array of vegetarian snacks and,\n",
      "controversially, roasted chicken drumsticks (“People need fucking protein,”\n",
      "Edgar had snapped when I timidly ventured that most of the attendees\n",
      "would be vegetarians).\n",
      "As I cleaned up and the guests began to depart, I heard a woman in a\n",
      "flowing purple dress thank Edgar for the event.\n",
      "“That girl you’ve got working for you is just lovely,” said the purple\n",
      "lady.\n",
      "“She’s my personal assistant,” Edgar said. “But she’s more like a\n",
      "daughter to me. I’m teaching her so much.”\n",
      "“I wish I’d had a mentor like you when I was her age,” the woman said.\n",
      "“So do I,” Edgar said. “I had to teach myself everything I know.”“To be quite frank,” the woman said, dropping her voice, “I wasn’t very\n",
      "impressed with that writer woman’s workshop. Arthur, the rabbi, and the\n",
      "minister were lovely. Perhaps next year you can give a lecture instead.”\n",
      "“Oh, I’m no public speaker,” Edgar said. I looked over and saw him\n",
      "actually blush with happiness.\n",
      "As I squeezed more organic dish liquid on another Pottery Barn plate, I\n",
      "knew I wasn’t going to come back to the Blessed Sanctuary. And in that\n",
      "moment, for the first time since I’d begun working there, I felt something\n",
      "that might be described as inner peace.\n",
      "At dusk, I went outside to ask Edgar’s permission to leave for the day.\n",
      "He nodded, barely seeming to notice me. He and Arthur were standing\n",
      "together with arms slung around each other’s waists, laughing gently at\n",
      "something Elizabeth was saying. Elizabeth’s sister Mary was laughing, too.\n",
      "All traces of anger had left Edgar’s face. He and Arthur looked like an older\n",
      "couple enjoying themselves immensely at a high school reunion. Or maybe\n",
      "they looked like a pair of medieval royals, grateful to dispense for a\n",
      "moment with the duties of state and simply enjoy themselves with members\n",
      "of their inner circle at court. I left them there, King Arthur and Queen\n",
      "Edgar, and drove out of their kingdom and into the real world.\n",
      "The next day, I called Edgar and told him I’d decided to enroll full-time\n",
      "at the local community college. I asked if he’d like two weeks’ notice. He\n",
      "said it wasn’t necessary, and without a trace of anger in his voice wished me\n",
      "well. I returned his good wishes in kind.\n",
      "The community college thing was a lie. I went out on the job hunt again\n",
      "and found a gig back home in Flemington at a “health bar” inside a twenty-\n",
      "thousand-square-foot mega-gym. My primary job was to make smoothies, a\n",
      "task at which I excelled. I also served espresso shots to juiced-up Jersey\n",
      "muscle-heads and wheatgrass shots to anorexic, farty, “vegan” trophy\n",
      "wives. My favorite customers were the cardiac rehab patients who met their\n",
      "physical therapists in the special mini-gym for medical cases and then\n",
      "stopped by my bar for a bagel with cream cheese and a mocha latte with\n",
      "whole milk.\n",
      "A couple of months later, while I was filling out new college\n",
      "applications (some schools actually let you apply in May for the next\n",
      "semester), I got an e-mail from Jason, the intern who had mysteriously\n",
      "disappeared. He asked how I was doing, and if I was still working at “that\n",
      "place.” He said he’d wanted to get to talk to me more, but he’d done hisbest to avoid Edgar at all costs, and that meant avoiding me, too. I wrote\n",
      "back that I was doing well, and that I’d, thankfully, left the Blessed\n",
      "Sanctuary behind. We exchanged a few more e-mails, and he invited me to\n",
      "meet him in New York for the day.\n",
      "I hadn’t had a meaningful interaction with a boy in nearly six months.\n",
      "This fact alone was enough to make my brain circuits override my\n",
      "trepidation about New York City. I told Jason I’d see him that weekend.\n",
      "I took out the cassette tape I’d used for the first time I drove to the\n",
      "Blessed Sanctuary, the one with Enya and Gregorian chanting and me\n",
      "saying soothing inspirational things. It didn’t seem quite right for this trip. It\n",
      "seemed a little too . . . cheesy. And boring. And like it was designed for\n",
      "someone I didn’t relate to as much anymore. So I made a mix tape of Liz\n",
      "Phair songs interspersed with my voice. “This is fucking awesome!” I said\n",
      "into the tape recorder. “Look, you’re on the train! Look around. Look at the\n",
      "windows. You can see outside. You’re safe. You can get off the train at any\n",
      "stop and then take the train back home. You could call a local taxi service\n",
      "anywhere and have them drive you to Flemington. You took your medicine\n",
      "today. You’ve got your journal with you. Did you bring your giraffe, Mary?\n",
      "Of course you did. See, you’re fine. I’m so proud of you.” It meshed rather\n",
      "well with Liz Phair’s expletive-laced lyrics. I rode the train listening to the\n",
      "cassette player on headphones. And I made it in just fine.\n",
      "Jason met me at Penn Station. He was cuter than I remembered, and\n",
      "looked way more relaxed. We greeted each other enthusiastically, and began\n",
      "walking down to Union Square. He was going to show me the L train,\n",
      "which would take us to a neighborhood in Brooklyn called Williamsburg.\n",
      "“It’s where all the punks and artists live now,” he told me as we\n",

      "sometimes. Typically, the kids seized on his appearance: he was slightly\n",

      "“Billy, you gotta calm down,” I said. “And try not to actually yell ‘fuck’\n",
      "in my classroom. I’m not mad, I’m just saying another teacher would\n",
      "probably throw you out.”\n",
      "“I’m sorry,” he said in a pained whisper. “I’m seriously sorry, miss. I’ll\n",

      "“You sure you don’t wanna get up and—”\n",

      "kill them. And I was getting to the point where I might actually consider\n",
      "doing that in order to shut them up.\n",
      "“That’s it!” I shouted, much louder than before. “What the hell is\n",
      "happening right now? Somebody tell me so we can just deal with it andmove on. Write me a note or some shit. I don’t care. Just do it now.”\n",
      "Pablo looked pleadingly at Billy. A glance passed between them in\n",
      "which permission was conferred.\n",
      "“Miss, don’t you know?” Pablo demanded excitedly, bouncing up and\n",
      "down. “Everybody in the school knows Billy took Viagra!” The students\n",
      "fell immediately into what I can only describe as a joyful silence.\n",
      "I paused and took a moment to let the information sink in. Meanwhile,\n",
      "twenty pairs of eyes watched eagerly for my reaction. Once I was fairly\n",
      "certain I’d actually heard what I thought I’d heard, I looked at Billy.\n",
      "“Billy,” I said slowly, enunciating each syllable perfectly. “Is this true?”\n",
      "“Yes,” he groaned, cringing.\n",
      "“And why . . . exactly . . . did you take Viagra?”\n",
      "“It was a bet, miss. It was a bet.”\n",

      "guys, and Jorge bet him fifty dollars it would work on young guys too.”\n",
      "“Jorge was right,” Billy moaned. “It wasn’t worth the money.”\n",
      "Slowly and deliberately, I placed my copy of Romeo and Juliet on the\n",
      "table. I tried to make it to my chair, but couldn’t. My legs were about to\n",

      "seriously—I mean, seriously—the stupidest fucking thing I have ever\n",
      "heard.” Then Billy was laughing, and then the whole class was laughing.\n",
      "We nearly rattled the windows.\n",
      "“Holy shit, miss, don’t make me laugh,” Billy groaned in between\n",
      "giggles. “It hurts when I laugh.”\n",
      "“Billy,” I said, trying to regain my composure. “Dude. You’re so much\n",
      "smarter than this. You’re probably the smartest person in this class. Sorry,\n",
      "you guys, but he is.” I had lost the ability to feign that they were all unique\n",
      "and special flowers.\n",
      "“Yo, that’s true, though,” Pablo said reflectively. “You are, bro. I’m\n",
      "sorry about your dick, yo. Like, it’s funny? But I bet it hurts.”\n",
      "“Thanks, man,” Billy wheezed. “Ouch. Shit.”\n",
      "“How could—why would—okay. Okay. Okay.” I took several deep\n",
      "breaths in a row, and the class quieted down. I think they were afraid I was\n",
      "actually going to pass out.“I—I have no idea what to do,” I said, standing up and dusting myself\n",
      "off. “Can you guys just, like, talk amongst yourselves for a minute quietly?\n",

      "Months passed, and I got my acceptance letter from Western Carolina\n",
      "University. It came in a big, lovely envelope stuffed with various letters of\n",
      "congratulations, as well as a request that I phone the departmental office\n",
      "when I received the letter. I did, and was bowled over with excitement when\n",
      "a honey-voiced official offered me a full ride plus a paid teaching\n",

      "surprise that it wasn’t the thin business-size envelope I’d expected. And\n",
      "then I pulled a big blue packet out of the mailbox.\n",
      "I stared at it in shock. Were the admissions people particularly cruel?\n",

      "needed to read.\n",
      "“Oh my God!” I shrieked, as if I’d won a sweepstakes. I jumped up and\n",
      "down on the floor, on my couch, on my bed. I performed a series of\n",
      "awkward yet enthusiastic high kicks. I considered doing a back-flip but\n",
      "remembered I had never done one previously, and that didn’t seem like the\n",
      "sort of skill one spontaneously exhibited on command. And then I called\n",
      "Tom.\n",
      "“Hey, what’s up?” he said in the way he always did, and I almost burst\n",
      "with happiness.\n",
      "“I got into Columbia,” I said.\n",
      "“What?” he said, his voice rising an octave and squeaking at the end.\n",
      "“I did. I got in.”\n",
      "“How?”\n",
      "“I don’t know, because I’m fucking smart?” I was shocked at myself for\n",
      "actually saying the words that had leaped to mind.\n",
      "He was quiet for a moment.\n",
      "“I’m sorry,” I said. “I didn’t mean to jump on you like that.” Oh, no.\n",
      "Now he’ll be angry. I’m sorry I’m sorry I’m sorry. Please don’t leave me.\n",
      "Please don’t ever leave me.\n",
      "“No,” he said. “You’re right. I deserved that.”\n",
      "What?\n",
      "“Congratulations,” he said. “That’s amazing.” He sounded wistful and\n",
      "sad and actually proud.\n",
      "“I’m not going, or anything,” I assured him. “I just wanted to see if I\n",
      "could get in. And I did, so now I can always say I got into Columbia. We\n",
      "can frame the acceptance letter and put it up in our bedroom!”\n",
      "“If I were you,” he said, “I’d really think about what the best choice is\n",
      "for you. Not for me or for us, but for you.”Something was wrong. Everything was right, but somehow something\n",
      "was wrong. He never spoke to me like this. Like an equal.\n",
      "“Oh, I want to come home,” I said, fighting the rising anxiety inside me.\n",
      "“Columbia would be too expensive, anyway. I mean, I can’t afford that.”\n",
      "“Yes, you can,” he said in the same weird, quiet way. “You can take out\n",
      "loans.”\n",
      "“Well, I’m not going,” I said resolutely. “I’m really not. Besides, I’ve\n",
      "already asked you to do a year with me living far away. I promise I’ll never\n",
      "move far away from you again.”\n",
      "The next day, I e-mailed the department head at Teachers College at\n",
      "Columbia and offered my thanks, but explained that I wouldn’t be coming\n",
      "to school in the fall. The day after that, Tom broke up with me.\n",
      "“Why are you doing this?” I sobbed, even though I knew there were a\n",
      "million reasons why.\n",
      "“Because this isn’t working,” he said. “You and me. We’re not good for\n",
      "each other. It hasn’t been good for a long time. You know it, too. And now\n",
      "you’re going to give up your dream to come back here and live with me,\n",
      "even though we make each other unhappy? No way. You can’t.” He was\n",
      "crying, too.\n",
      "Alongside the pain, I felt an enormous surge of relief. I ignored it.\n",
      "“But we were going to get married,” I wailed. “And have a house, and a\n",
      "dog, and a kid. And now I don’t even know what I’m going to do.”\n",
      "“You’re going to move to New York City,” he said. “And your dream is\n",
      "finally going to come true.”\n",
      "The next day, puffy-eyed and weak, I called Columbia and asked if I\n",
      "could please come to their school anyway. They kindly said yes, and\n",
      "advised me that I’d better move quickly if I wanted to get those $60,000 in\n",
      "loans. I said I’d see them in a couple of months. Then I called Western\n",
      "Carolina University and politely un-accepted their offer of admission. As I\n",
      "spoke to the woman from WCU, my voice cracked a little.\n",
      "“You okay, honey?” she asked.\n",
      "“I’m just going to miss Asheville,” I said, sniffling. “I’ve missed it all\n",
      "year out here and I thought I was gonna be home in a couple months, but\n",
      "now it turns out I’m not.”\n",
      "“Well, honey,” she said. “We’ll still be here. You can always come and\n",
      "visit, you know. But if I were your age and I got the chance, I’d give New\n",
      "York City a try. You only get one shot at this kinda thing.”I thanked her and hung up.\n",
      "The last couple of months in Texas were a whirlwind of preparations. I\n",
      "thoroughly enjoyed my drive back East, stopping in Asheville to stay with\n",
      "friends for a few days before I made it up to New York. I managed to avoid\n",
      "Tom, which wasn’t hard at all because he wasn’t exactly trying to hang out\n",
      "with me. I moved into an apartment with two women I met through\n",
      "Craigslist, and delighted in the two dogs and the cat with whom I also\n",
      "shared my new place. They didn’t belong to me, so I didn’t have to do\n",
      "anything other than cuddle them, which was ideal.\n",
      "Then there was Teachers College, the most obviously-named graduate\n",
      "school in the world. It sat just north of Columbia’s main campus, a\n",
      "labyrinthine pile of bricks and stone. I busied myself with selecting courses,\n",
      "buying books, and learning the geography of the Upper West Side. Night\n",
      "classes began, as did my daily student-teaching assignment at a public\n",
      "middle school in Manhattan. And sometime in mid-September, I realized\n",
      "with a start that I hadn’t had a panic attack in . . . in . . . I couldn’t remember\n",
      "how long. Not when Tom had dumped me, not when I’d said good-bye to\n",
      "my colleagues, not when I’d driven alone through midnight summer storms\n",
      "in Texas, not when I’d sat in the front passenger seat of my mom’s car and\n",
      "barreled through the Lincoln Tunnel, not when I’d discovered my apartment\n",
      "of choice was a rather steep walk-up. I hadn’t even panicked on the day I\n",
      "met my perpetually disapproving cooperating teacher, the woman charged\n",
      "with mentoring me while educating thirty-five precocious New York City\n",
      "seventh-graders. She had the bitterness one only finds in certain older\n",
      "teachers, the ones who’ve been in the system far too long and who still\n",
      "nurture a wish that they’d done something else. She watched my lessons\n",
      "with a sour expression on her face, but somehow it didn’t throw me.\n",
      "No matter how stressed or tired or uninspired I felt, I didn’t panic. I was\n",
      "too busy to panic. If I wasn’t downtown at middle school, I was uptown at\n",
      "grad school. If I wasn’t uptown at grad school, I was doing homework in\n",
      "my bedroom. And if I wasn’t actually at one of these three sites, I was on\n",
      "the subway en route from one to another. I had discovered that subway\n",
      "trains generally didn’t get stuck in one place for over four minutes, and that\n",
      "in New York City there was always a Starbucks with a bathroom when I\n",
      "needed it. I might have to wait in the store while a drunk woman took a shit\n",
      "on the floor beside the toilet, but I would eventually get access to that toilet.To my enormous surprise, I found the strange manic pace of life in New\n",
      "York oddly soothing. Perhaps my anxiety was not only crowded out by my\n",
      "daily obligations but by the wild quirks of my fellow New Yorkers. On any\n",
      "given block in New York, I was bound to be, if not the sanest individual, at\n",
      "least not one of the craziest. And there were more of “the craziest” than any\n",
      "other type.\n",
      "I did not, for example, shit on any floors in public or private spaces. I\n",
      "did not walk down the street screaming about the coming of the Messiah,\n",

      "grades seven through twelve.\n",
      "One night in September, I went out to a pub near Columbia with some\n",
      "new friends. During the dinner, Tom called me and promptly apologized for\n",
      "everything he’d ever done wrong in our relationship. He was almost\n",
      "certainly drunk, but I enjoyed the moment nevertheless—at first.\n",
      "“Oh, we both made mistakes,” I said magnanimously, out on the street\n",
      "where I wouldn’t interrupt my friends’ heated debate about charter school\n",
      "funding. “And you really did me a lovely favor by breaking up with me.\n",

      "Sara.”\n",
      "“Good to hear,” I said faintly. “I have to go now, and do significant\n",

      "within four fucking months? I wanted to throw up. I wanted to punch a fist\n",

      "And this was one thing I could not abide.\n",

      "have a series of sexual encounters with a single someone who would then\n",

      "on one of those Brooklyn streets where all the shops are aggressively\n",

      "commercial. I avoided alcohol but encouraged his consumption, as I’d\n",
